- 👋 Hi,<br/> My name is Bashir, but my friends call me Bash. You can too!🥳
I am a software engineer from 🇳🇬. I enjoy travelling and living the soft life🥂.
I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I'm learning a lot from the open-source community and love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happens through open-source.

 <br/>
 
- 🌱 I work mostly with Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI and Python. I have experience building cross-platform mobile products using Flutter, Dart and a bit of ionic. I have built awesome products and can work in a cross-functional team. I am well versed in web development tools like HTLM, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, NodeJS and MongoDB. I also have hands-on cloud engineering experience specializing in AWS Cloud Computing. Github serves as a host for the professional projects I've worked on as well as fun projects I handle in order to master new concepts and frameworks.
<br/>

- 💞️ I’m currently building exciting products at Gris Vivant. Our flagship product is live.....please have a look<br/> [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hunt-property-search-by-gv/id6504540302] (Hunt iOS)<br/>[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grisvivantlimited.hunt] (Hunt Android).
